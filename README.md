# Inefficient machine that conducts simple tasks with the help of Arduino
## Welcome
### An inefficient machine out of a simple task, such as making coffee or juice. The idea was to create some sort of machine that would react without any direct input. The journey began with a pitch for a kinetic sculpture that would react to noise pollution. This was a subject of brainstorm and prototyping movements for a couple of weeks, until we realised that this would be hard to implement and make interactive, since its input would be implicit interactions from noise. Instead we went down another route, and found enjoyment in exploring gear movements and how kinetic energy travels through gears. The time we spent here was not completely lost, but we felt like we needed a purpose for our gear sculpture - otherwise it would just be another gear sculpture you often see at Swedish technical museums.
